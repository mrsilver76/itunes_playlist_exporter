' iTunes Playlist Exporter v1.3.0, Copyright Â© 2020 Richard Lawrence
' https://github.com/mrsilver76/itunes_playlist_exporter
'
' A script which connects to iTunes and exports all playlists in m3u
' format. It can also (optionally) adjust the paths of playlists to
' support NAS drives and upload them to Plex.
'
' Notes: * DRM'ed music is not exported and not supported by Plex.
'        * Existing playlists created (with only content from the library
'          you're uploading to) will be deleted.
'        * If you're not running Windows 10, you need to install Curl which
'          is available from https://curl.haxx.se/windows/

' ----- Configuration settings -------------------------------------------

' LOCAL_PLAYLIST_LOCATION - the location to store the generated playlists. If
' you plan on allowing other users/machines/software (such as Plex) to access
' these playlists then you need to pick a location which is either on a network
' drive or shared. If this is left blank then a folder will be created at 
' "C:\Users\username\Music\Exported iTunes Playlists" and used.

Const LOCAL_PLAYLIST_LOCATION = ""

' This is useful if you use playlists to help create other playlists and you don't
' want these 'interim' ones being exported. 

Const IGNORE_PREFIX = "z "

' If you plan on allowing other users/machines/software to access the playlist
' then you may find that the location embedded in the playlist file isn't accessible
' for them. For example, "D:\MyMusic" won't be accessible by a NAS or another
' computer. To solve this you can use the following options to modify your paths
' so they point to the correct location.

' USE_LINUX_PATHS - if set to True will cause two things to happen:
'                     1. All existing paths will replace \ with /
'                     2. The created playlist will use Linux line-endings (\n)
'                        instead of DOS line-endings (\r\n)

Const USE_LINUX_PATHS = False

' These two options allow you to search (PATH_FIND) for a string in a path
' and then replace (PATH_REPLACE) it with something else.

' PATH_FILE - the text to find within the path of a song

Const PATH_FIND = "C:\Users\Richard\Music\iTunes\iTunes Music\Music\"

Const PATH_REPLACE = "\\Storage\Content\Music\Songs\Richard\"

' ----- Plex specific configuration settings ---------------------

' These options relate to automatically uploading your playlists to Plex
' Media Server. Plex is free software (with an optional paid for pass) that
' allows you to manage and view your audio and video content. More details
' can be found at https://www.plex.tv/

' Note: Uploading will only happen if you provide a valid URL and token.
'       The script will happily run without these being provided.

' TOKEN - the API token required for this script to be able to access Plex.
' Do not share your token with anyone. For details on how to find this, see
' https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/

Const TOKEN=""

' SERVER - the URL path to the server and port number. This can start http
' or https depending on whether or not you're forcing secure connections. You
' can use 127.0.0.1 to mean "the same machine".

Const SERVER = "http://127.0.0.1:32400/"

' LIBRARY_ID - the number of the library that the playlists will be loaded into.
' Make sure this library exists, is set up for music and contains all the songs
' that you have in the playlists. To find your library, go into the Plex web client,
' hover the mouse over the library you want and look at the URL. It will end with
' "source=xx" where xx is the library ID.

' stored in LOCAL_PLAYLIST_LOCATION. If Plex is on a different machine to the
